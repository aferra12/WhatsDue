# Iteration Backlog
- As a professor, I want my organizer to look clean so that when students view it is nice and easy to look at. 
- (Nice to have) As a professor, I want to upload a file (json?, YAML?) and have the organizer parse that file for me, so that I can 
quickly have an organized course. 

# After Meeting on 4/23
- Add professor dashboard
- Prepopulate the forms
- Improve overall flow (less circular)

# Tasks
- Continue to use Bootstrap to improve visuals of website
- Comment and organize code so that it would be easy to read and understand for someone who has never seen it before
- Work with YAML and reading in json to possibly add a file upload feature

# Final Retrospective

Our group had a winding road to reach the final product of What's Due, but we are very happy and proud of what we have developed. 
Our original idea of a platform for students to communicate about course work and outline their upcoming events transformed into an
application where professors are able to beautifully organize their courses and easily keep students up to date with their school work.

Our problem statement was: "Professors do not currently have a tool to organize class material on their websites in an easy, organized, efficient way."
Our group proposed a solution of: "We will create a simple tool to organize course material in multiple, easy to use views. 
Professors can easily upload pertinent material to be viewed by students."

Our application allows professors to organize their course material in "multiple, easy to use views" and uploading material is very easy. 
With the help of YAML templates, professors are able to add information such as course name, start time, end time, and what days of the 
week lectures are on with just a few button clicks. Professors are also able to upload all kinds of course material, from homeworks to 
lecture slides, and students can easily download these files to their own devices. In addition, professors can easily add due dates and 
course meeting times to a class calendar, so that students can export this calendar to their own google calendar and be kept up to date
with what is happening in the course. This course material is also easily sorted on the web page, and can be filtered by material type
and due date, so students and professors can quickly find what they are looking for. Professors and students can easily navigate between
the course overview, course material, and course calendar, allowing them to view their course in many different ways very quickly. In
addition, we added a feature that allows a professor to instantly notify students via text when a new assignment is added to thier course
or an assignment is added; no longer do professors have to craft mass emails, our application will send these texts automatically. Professors
need only to link a personal Twilio account, and they are able to upload their students phone numbers to text them. 

We were able to deliver all of our Must-Haves on our RSD, however there were a few pivots along the way. Adding in text notifications was
also an added feature, one that we did not plan for, even in our Nice-to-Haves. In the future, we hope to extend the YAML features to 
allow professors to populate the entire webpage with one file, and hope to make our web application compatible with many other calendar
platforms outside of Google. 

Our final product was not achieved without struggle along the way. We had multiple meetings with our project advisors and professor
to discuss our progress and their visions for our product. This led to us making multiple pivots, forcing us to work many long nights 
and early mornings, and hold many group meetings via Zoom to discuss how to best and most quickly implement the suggestions that we were
given. Moving to remote classes was definitely a challenge, as our group thrived off of group coding and bouncing ideas off of each other.
We were able to adapt and do this over Zoom however, and also utilized GitHub to view and give suggestions on each others work.

If we could start this project over again, we would hope to have a bit clearer vision of what we were setting out to create prior to 
beginning. Although no group begins a project and knows what their final product will look like, many have a clearer picture of what it
will be like than we did. This caused our work to be slow at times, as we had to figure out how to pivot and re-shape our application to
handle new demands. However, in the end we were able to overcome these pivots and develop something we are all very proud of. Ideally, 
we would all have been together in person to develop our application, as this makes communication much easier. Nonetheless, our group 
did a great job of adapting to the circumstances and achieved something awesome. 

Thank you very much for all your help and guidance throughout the creation of What's Due, we are all very appreciative!
