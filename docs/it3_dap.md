# Iteration Backlog
-> As a professor, I want the course information to show up in the calendar, so that I can easily view all upcoming events. 

-> As a professor, I want to be able to upload/attach assignments to the course organizer so that students can view them. 


# Tasks
-> Use Handlebars to access inputted course information and add it to the calendar.

-> Add capabilities to upload/attach assignments to the table.  

# Retrospective for Iteration 3

We were able to successfully implement both of our iteration backlog promises for Iteration 3, as we added functionality to be able to save files into our database, as well as allow users to download them to their devices. Additionally, information that is inserted about courses and assignments can now be easily added to the google calendar portion of the website, so users can easily see the upcoming events for their classes. Although we did not implement steps towards making our web app into a fully functional api yet, we took a considerable amount of time to read and learn about how we are planning to do so, taking lots of notes and inspiration from existing apis such as the spotify developers api documentation. Despite this, both of our user story promises, "As a professor, I want the course information to show up in the calendar, so that I can easily view all upcoming events." and "As a professor, I want to be able to upload/attach assignments to the course organizer so that students can view them.", were fully accomplished by our work in iteration 3. 

We did face the challenge of being apart from each other, as much of our coding development has been done as a group. We do a good job of bouncing ideas off of each other and working collaboratively, and this is much harder to do when we are not all together. We have been holding group zoom meetings, and allowing different team members to share their screen and code while others provide feedback, however this is just not the same as working in person with each other. Even so, team zoom meetings were a productive way to help individual group members work through problems and places where they had gotten stuck, and this is something we will continue to do for iteration 4. Something we could have done differently is started a little earlier so that we had time to possibly begin implementing pieces for the api, however the delays in work were almost entirely due to short turn around time from iteration 2 and the fact that we all were getting acclimated to new learning styles and environments. We will also continue to use branching to make sure that the work we divide up is organized and easily visualized on our project board. 

For our next iteration, we are planning on taking time to make our webiste more appealing to the eye, as well as beginning to lay the groundwork and implement what is needed for our web app to be an api. We also will spend time to make our code cleaner, so that operations such as adding to the calendar and displaying events in the table happen more seamlessly on the backend. More specific plans can be seen in it4_dap.md, coming soon!
