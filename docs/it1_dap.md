# Iteration Backlog
-> As a professor, I want to be able to view my course information on a simple website in a list view. 
-> As a professor, I want to be able to add information about my course to view on the simple website. 


# Tasks
-> Create database to hold information about a course. 
-> Create HTML base for basic website to display course information. 
-> Implement functions to allow professors to add information about their courses. 

# Retrospective for Iteration 1
-> We were able to deliver both of our promised user stories for iteration 1, as we created a basic website using HTML where a professor can upload their course information and view it in a basic, yet organized format. We built our backend in Java, using the web server and dao files from lecture as outlines. We were challenged by a short time frame after changing our idea, but were still able to deliver all that we promised in entirety. Now that we have our idea solidified and a good understanding of what languages we are going to use, we are set up well to deliver our promises for iteration 2. Our first goal for iteration 2 will be building out our back end further so that when a professor uploads course information, they are able to exit and return to the website without their information being lost. We plan to use a persister to help implement this.
